    abstract = {Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is a phenomenon in which worker bees from a beehive or European honey bee colony abruptly disappear. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease),[1] the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006[2] in conjunction with a drastic rise in the number of disappearances of Western honeybee colonies in North America at that time. /// growth of neonicotinoids such as clothianidin and imidacloprid, some of the most widely-used pesticides in the world, has roughly tracked rising bee deaths since 2005 /// Colony collapse is significant economically because many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by European honey bees. Shortages in the US have increased the cost to farmers, renting bees for pollination services, up to 20{\%} at times. /// Losses had remained stable since the 1990s at 17{\%}-20{\%} per year attributable to a variety of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. /// They are responsible for pollination of approximately one third of the United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, soybeans, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers and strawberries.},

    abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

    abstract = {An important parameter in evaluating the activity of a honeybee colony is given by the number of bees leaving and entering the hive as a function of time. The microprocessor-controlled counter described here presents many advantages over previous counting devices. The counter fits the standard hive measurement (10 combs), and provides access to the hive via 32 bi- directional channels. The very small infrared detectors in each channel are only 0.1 mm apart, and are controlled by an asynchronous sequential algorithm, which improves the counter's precision. Results of measurements of the daily activity of honeybee colonies under different conditions (normal, in the presence of pesticides, or during swarming) are presented},

While the sensor concept is easily adaptable to a wide range of objects or organisms which pass through an enclosed area, our version of the sensor was designed specifically for monitoring bumblebee colonies.

The capacitance sensor provides all the information of the optical sensors and additional information on the bee size and velocity. The sensor is expected to provide entomologists with more efficient methods of studying the foraging activities of bees.},

@article{ art:decourtye_honeybee_2011,
    abstract = {Losses of foraging bees are sometimes attributed to altered flight pattern between a meliferous plant treated with an insecticide and the hive. Only a limited number of studies has investigated the impact of pesticides on homing flight due to the difficulty of measuring the flight time between the food source and the hive. Monitoring the flights of the foraging bees needs their individual identification. The number of bees monitored simultaneously and the time span during which observations can be made limit most of the monitoring techniques. However, techniques of automatic tracking and identification of individuals have the potential to revolutionize the study of the ecotoxicological effects of xenobiotics on the bee behaviors. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) offer numerous advantages such as an unlimited number of codes, a large number of simultaneous recording, and a quick reading, especially through materials (e.g., wood). The aim of this study was to show how the RFID device can be used to study the effects of pesticides on both the behavioral traits and the lifespan of bees. In this context, we have developed a method under tunnel to automatically record the displacements of foragers individualized with RFID tags and to detect the alteration of the flight pattern between an artificial feeder and the hive. Fipronil was selected as test substance due to the lack of information on the effects of this insecticide on the foraging behavior of free-flying bees. We showed that oral treatment of 0.3 ng of fipronil per bee (LD50/20) reduced the number of foraging trips. The strengths of our approach were briefly discussed.},

    abstract = {This paper summarizes an approach based on stereo vision to recover honeybee trajectories in 3D at the beehive entrance. The 3D advantage offered by stereo vision is crucial to overcome the rough constraints of the application (number of bees, target dynamics and light). Biologists have highlighted the close scale influence of the environment on bees dynamics. We propose to transpose this idea to enhance our tracking process based on Global Nearest Neighbors. Our method normalizes track/observation association costs that are originally not uniformly distributed over the scene. Therefore, the structure of the scene is needed in order to compute relative distances with the targets. The beehive and especially the flight board is the referent environment for bees, so we propose a method to reconstruct the flight board surface from the noisy and incomplete disparity maps provided by the stereo camera},

    abstract = {Honey bees are responsible for more than half of the pollination across the world, hence they have an important role in agriculture. In recent years, the number of honey bees have declined due to the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), which may be due to possible causes that include climate change and pollution. Since honey bees start from their hives to go for pollination, their activities around the hive are a good indicator of their health. The bee hive's health status and the activities of honey bees can be related to the environment in which they live, thus finding a quantitative measure of the bee activities is very important and can benefit the beekeepers. This paper will present a data acquisition and monitoring system that utilizes image processing techniques for extracting data from the videos of the bee hive's entrance taken at the front or the top of the hive's entrance. The system developed as part of this research utilizes two different approaches based on the Illumination-invariant Change Detection Algorithm and Signal-to-Noise Ratio to estimate the number of bees at the entrance of the hives.},
